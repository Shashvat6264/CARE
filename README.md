   CARE- CHILD ADOPTION AND REGISTRATION ON ETHEREUM
</h1>

<p align="center"><b>CARE</b> is a decentralized app built on <b>Ethereum</b>, <br> Aims at creating an interface for people to report and track children who have been abandoned/orphaned. <br> This is to ensure that these children do not get exploited for cheap labour or fall into the trap of trafficking.<br/><br/></p>

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start
To use the image one must have a test net to deploy the smart contracts as well as metamask extension to interact with Web3.js integrated into the app.

### :arrow_forward:Steps to Run:running: the project
<!-- 1. Clone the repository in your machine.
2. Open a terminal in the repository root folder.
3. Install dependencies for the project from the requirements.txt file by using the command. 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Since, a database file is provided in the repository, you can directly run the Django server by the command: 
```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```
5. If in any case the Database gets damaged, deleted or changed, you must migrate the already existing migrations to a new database. Command to migrate models to a new database is: 
```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
```
6. You can return to step 4 i.e. running the server, after doing migrations.
7. After running the server, go to the URL **"127.0.0.1:8000"** to see the app running. -->
1. Deploy the contracts to your test blockchain.
2. Connect metamask to your test server.
3. Now we will run the frontend application.
4. Use the command to install all node dependencies to compile the application:
```bash
npm install
```
5. After completion, use the command to run the application on your localhost:
```bash
npm start
```
6. You can test the app now.:confetti_ball::tada:

The video explains the working of the project as well as all its technicalities.

## :bookmark_tabs:Why CARE?
Reasons to Use <b>CARE</b> :
1. The decentralized nature of the app will help maintain the integrity of the data and ensure easy traceability of each child. 
2. Using <I>Polygon</I> for deployment during production, enhances our to be scalable. Indeed is cost-efficient, very reliable.
3. CARE guarantees reliability by incorporating unique features at the organization and user backend.
4. A smooth transition of a child from it‚Äôs reporter to agencies and further till its adoption takes place.

## :dart:Future Scope
The project application can be further extended as:
1. Concerned Government Authorities can monitor the ledger to ensure proper care is given to all registered children.
2. Collaboration with the Government mandated to verify child adoption to safer hands.
3. Eventually a policy can be initiated by the Government for raising funds for the particular orphan agencies/organizations who keep a check on all the health care, education and other welfare of the children they admitted. 
4. Location based services to guide to the nearest orphanage. 
5. Alert to nearby orphan organizations for easy picking of victims.
6. The similar essence and working of the project can be used for stray and unvaccinated pets (Animal Welfare)
